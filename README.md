# Convert-audio-to-musical-notes
This is a fullstack project and was my first experiment in model training.
The project's purpose is to get a piece of music as input from the user and convert it into musical notes, the user will get to download the piece.
The project should be recognized as a learning opportunity rather than a finalized product.
The dataset and metadata are only an example to the real ones and to get the model accuracy of about 68% I had to use about 1200 audio files.
