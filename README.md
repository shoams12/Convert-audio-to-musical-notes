# Convert Audio To Musical Notes
ðŸŽµ A Fullstack Project for Music Enthusiasts ðŸŽ¶

This project transforms an audio file into musical notes, providing an interactive way for users to understand and recreate musical compositions.

-Project Overview-

This was my first venture into machine learning model training, combining backend expertise with frontend design to create a user-friendly application. The project is intended as a learning opportunity, showcasing concepts rather than being a production-ready product.

Key features include:

Input: Upload an audio file (e.g., .mp3, .wav).

Processing: A trained ML model extracts musical features.

Output: Downloadable musical notes in a standard format (PDF).

Note: The dataset and metadata used are examples, and the model's current accuracy is approximately 68%, trained on a dataset of 1,200 audio files.
